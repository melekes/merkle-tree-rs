# Merkle Tree implemented in Rust programming language

## Usage

## Development

### Step 1. Create development environment

You will need [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) if
you want to develop this library inside a container. If you already have rust
on your computer and fine with downloading some dependencies, feel free to skip
this step.

```
$ make create_dev_env
$ make run_shell
```

### Step 2. Build & test

```
$ cargo build --features "dev"
$ cargo test
```
